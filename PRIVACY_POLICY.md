## DYELry: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the DYELry app!
This is an open source app. The source code is available on GitHub non-commercial purposes.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally
identifiable information. The app operates offline and doesn't use the Internet connection at all. All the data created
by you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or
uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the
app protects your privacy, please email me or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will do what I can to address the
issue.

Yours sincerely,  
Igor Pavlov
